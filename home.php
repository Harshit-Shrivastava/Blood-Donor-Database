<p class="ex" align="justify">

Everyday, hundreds of people require blood for a transfusion, a surgery or some medical procedure. 
In many cases, especially open heart surgery, there is need for fresh blood and therefore a need for donors.<br/><br/>

If you are a healthy donor, and do not mind taking a little time out of your daily schedule
to donate blood when someone is in an emergency, please <font color="#D13E19">JOIN US</font>. 
You might be able to save a life or help ease the trauma for the kin of a patient. 
What's more, this very service might help you when in time of need.<br/><br/>

United Blood Services tries to help victims/patients/those in need of blood. 
It is an attempt to reach out to these individuals in need of blood and connect them to those willing to donate.<br/><br/>

The approach is multi-pronged...United Blood Services will serve as a public directory of 
voluntary donors The service allows those in need of blood to mention their needs which are then 
made visible to a wide audience. A comprehensive database will help individuals locate the nearest 
Blood Bank.<br/><br/>

You can go to the nearest government approved blood centre, which is based on voluntary non/remunerated blood 
donation and make your significant contribution to saving life of a patient by donating blood. 
Your contribution is extremely valuable to us.<br/></br>
